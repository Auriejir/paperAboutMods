\section{introduction}

\subsection{Why this document ?}

I've always loved play with my games' datas, create new things, alter others and test the limits of every single game I can lay hand on. But now I am going to work for the video game industry, I can't help but asking myself "how can I create games anyone can modify to fit his/her needs ?" and "what does it takes to create such game ?". I started those researches in order to find an answer to those two questions, hoping it would help me creating more flexible games in a first time and maybe helping other to create mod-friendly games for generations of modders.

\subsection{What do you mean by "mod" ?}

The word Mod is to take here as a shorthand for "game modification".

A mod is everything that alters the way the game is originally meant to be played. Said unmodified game is usually called "vanilla".

Mods can take many different forms, it can be a simple texture or a model change, the creation of any new item, character or map or even completely altering the original game to create a whole new one. When  are usually called "complete conversion"

In a result, mods can make the game much heavier thant the “vanilla” version, and may require much more power from the computer. Depending of the skill of the modder, the mod is more or less optimized and can impact strongly on the performances of the game, or evenbadly interact with other mods.

\section{Famous Examples}

\subsection{The ones who were intended to}

\subsubsection{World of Warcraft}

World of Warcraft was announced by Blizzard in September 2001, publicly released in November 2004 In USA, New Zealand and Australia, and in Korea and Europe in 2005. First players were allowed to register some macros, then full “add ons” were developped and spread in and by the community. These add ons were meant to only be “visuals”. World of Warcraft being a Massively Multiplayer Online Game, each player had to be equal in term of content, stuff, non playing character…
Many of these add ons help the player to manage his interface, to give him more information about quests, bosses, rare mobs, way to improve reputation for a certain faction… One of them, GearScore, gave a “level” to each item depending of its stats, and this add on became preponderant to rant a character, even leading to excluding some players, their stuff just weren’t good enough to take part in raid or dungeon.

In a result, when Blizzard released the biggest update for World of Warcraft, Cataclysm, in   December 2010, they included to their new “vanilla” version a lot of the most used add ons. For example, the item level (ilvl)  (used by the add on GearScore) was used as part of the gameplay. Each player was required a minimum of mean ilvl in his stuff to apply in the dungeon or raid search. It garanteed the raid leader player with enough stuff to not be a burden, and hopefully a minimum of knowledge of the strategy.

This exemple show that keeping an careful eye on mods created and loved by the community is a safe way to know how to improve your media. If most of your players want a specific interface upgrade, it can be a way to produce a better game. Also, a player who dedicate enough of his time to conceive and produce a mod is more likely to buy your next game or dlc/extension.

\subsubsection{Warcraft III}

Warcraft III Reign of Chaos, and then Frozen Throne is a real time strategy game released by Blizzard in July 2002. Even with the vanilla version, a map editor was realeased, allowing player to create their own maps, with factions, events, grounds, forest and shops entirely editable. These maps were playable in solo mode or even online with strangers. A lot of maps were created and some mods became famous and were trasnposed in other games when possible.
\begin{itemize}
\item Tower Defense : Waves of ennemy mobs spawns from one or more points and follow a determined path. Each player can build tower to defend the path and kill the monster before the reach the end point. Depending on the version the player could even build his towers in shape of a labyrinth to lengthen the path of the mobs. One “official” Tower Defense map (Defense of the Crystal Tower) was released with Frozen Throne in 2003
\item Hero Defense : Lookalike of Tower Defense. In this mod the player control a single hero, based on hero and units from the vanilla version, with stronger and more diverse abilities. This mod is really focused on team play. A variant is Enfo, with two teams of 6, where players can use spell to annoy and handicap the ennemy team. The remaining team was victorious.
\item Buy and Sell : 4 Players are sellers and try to get the better profit possible, the other players compete as buyers, trying to buy the more unit from the sellers to destroy their opponents. The buyers cannot buy any unit without the sellers . 
\item Line Wars : Two teams of opponent players compete in a small symetrical map to destroy the enemy base with the help of uncontrolable minions. Players can spend the gold earned on kills by improving their base and minions or upgrading their own stats.
\item Defense of the Ancients (Dota) : more codified and complex version of LIne Wars. Two team of five players battle in a large map with three lanes (path from one base to another) and 
a “jungle” (wild forst populated with neutral monsters) wrapping the central lane. Both base are represented by “Ancient” (animated tree of the elven faction of Warcraft).
\end{itemize}

The DotA mod was the most famous of all and was played by more than 10 millions of players. Later this mod inspired a new type of game : MOBA (Massively Online Battle Arena). Some games were created, inspired by the DotA mod : Dota2 (produced by Valve), Smite (Hi-Rez Studios), Heroes of Newerth (S2 Games), and most of all League of Legends (Riot Games). 

As an exemple,  League of legends, in the beginning of 2014, recorded more than 67 millions of monthly players and 10 millions daily players. These games participated in the soaring of the electronic sport (e-sport). Big societies like Coca Cola, Samsung, BenQ, Asus, Razer, SKT Telecom invest a lot of money in e-sport team and professional player, people win their life playing games, and the cash prizes has never been higher (more than 2 millions dollars).

And all that started with a mod designed by two young gamers in 2002.

\subsection{The ones who were not}

\subsubsection{The Half-Life series}

initially based on the DOOM engine (but remade at 70 percent), the first half-life saw one of the most popular complete conversion still in use nowadays : counter strike.

\section{Requirements}

In this section, we will think about what does making a moddable game implies. Those rules are obviously not mandatory and many moddable games don’t follow them all but, from a modder’s point of view, they are most welcome.

\subsection{General advices}
Making a moddable game can follow the same rules than a group project : the file organization must be clear, documentation must be precise and, if possible, easy to access. 
the easyest to understand your orgaization is, the more modders you get. the more modders you get, the more content they create. the more content your game get, the more appealing it gets to new players. Easier said than done but if the job is well done, your game may still be selling after 10 years like Morrowind does.

\subsection{Architecture}
The last paragraph stated “the file organization must be clear” which, ironically, is as unclear as it can be. So, we will think about how files should / might / can be organized in order to avoid trouble in the conception phase in a first time and make your game more appealing to mod in a second time. But, for starters, let’s discuss some little details about general coding.
As many games are not done from scratch nowadays, we won’t spend days discussing game engine and how they should be done… That said, for the three remaining ones, it is important to keep in mind some little things :
\begin{itemize}
\item modding is experimenting, never say “they will never be a negative / eccessive value” negative gravity value or five billions gold are frequent so, either shield your inputs or, better, use the most generic functions you can.
\item modding is forgetting things, always think about a default file in case you can’t find the one requested. a silent sound, a default mesh, even a doNothing script… your level designer will be happy to see your defaultTrollFace.obj instead of crashing back to his desktop without any explaination.
\item modding is 90 percent testing, if something goes wrong, say it, preferably in game in a pop-up window explaining the error clearly with three buttons : “continue”, “crash” and “continue for all”. you might also put these in a log but with parsimony, those files can become huge...
\item modding is often wanting to do something new / unexpected. So, if you can think your code to be able to include add-ons, you might create the ultimate moddable engine.
\end{itemize}
Now that I defined what modding is, let’s talk about the elephant in the room… You can have a perfectly moddable game and a huge community of modders if it is a pain to install, only a few part of the ones who could have enjoyed your game with mods will try.
So, when you think about your data architecture, itis important not to make it over complicated

\subsection{Files format}

\subsection{Editor or not ?}
an editor might seems to be a time loss at the beginning but, well done, it really can make things easier on the long run. It can allow level designers to work on maps on their own.
