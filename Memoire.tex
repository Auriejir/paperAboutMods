\section{introduction}

\subsection{Why this document ?}

I've always loved play with my games' datas, create new things, alter others and test the limits of every single game I can lay hand on. But now I am going to work for the video game industry, I can't help but asking myself "how can I create games anyone can modify to fit his/her needs ?" and "what does it takes to create such game ?". I started those research in order to find an answer to those two questions, hoping it would help me creating more flexible games in a first time and maybe helping other to create mod-friendly games for generations of modders.

\subsection{What do you mean by "mod" ?}

The word Mod is to take here as a shorthand for "game modification". 

A mod is everything that alters the way the game is originally meant to be played. Said unmodified game is usually called "vanilla".

Mods can take many different forms, it can be a simple texture or a model change, the creation of any new item, character or map or even completely altering the original game to create a whole new one.
